# My-Coding-Practices

Here I have added all of my solved coding problems from different online judges and some basic data structure and algorithm problems.
To solve these, sometimes I have been able to solve them of my own and sometimes I have to take help from different sites.
There are multiple solutions for same problem, not all of them may work properly but most of them will do fine.
I will update this repository on regular basis with whatever coding problems I try to solve
I hope, this repository can be useful for beginner problem solver. You can find some basic and also advanced coding problem solutions here.
